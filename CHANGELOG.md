# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed
- `/add-provider` and the `add-provider` agent tool now persist the new provider to opencode's **global config file** (the one opencode actually loads) instead of via `client.config.update`, which wrote an unloaded `<cwd>/config.json`. Providers added through the UI no longer disappear on restart.

### Added
- `/delete-provider` TUI slash command and `delete-provider` agent tool: remove a provider from the global config (comments preserved) and delete that provider's stored credential from the auth store.
- `src/opencode-config.ts`: comment-preserving global-config writer (via `jsonc-parser`) plus an auth-store editor for credential removal.

### Changed
- `/add-provider` now persists a minimal provider stub (no frozen `models` block), keeping the model list discovery-driven and the user's config clean.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- `add-provider` server tool for web/desktop provider setup (no TUI required)
- `refresh-models` server tool now performs full live re-discovery and config update (previously only cleared cache)

### Changed
- Extracted shared command logic into `src/commands.ts` to deduplicate between TUI commands and server tools
- Refactored TUI `/add-provider` and `/reload-models` to use shared logic

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- Automatic model discovery from any provider with a `baseURL` at startup
- [models.dev](https://models.dev) metadata enrichment (context windows, costs, capabilities, modalities)
- `/add-provider` TUI slash command for interactive provider setup
- `/reload-models` TUI slash command for in-session model re-discovery
- `refresh-models` server tool to clear the models.dev metadata cache
- `displayStyle` option to control model display names (`slug` vs `name`)
- Security: URL validation, model ID sanitization, error message redaction
- Stale cache fallback when models.dev is unreachable
- Environment variable support for API keys (`OPENCODE_LOCAL_<ID>_API_KEY`)
